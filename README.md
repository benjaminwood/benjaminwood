### Hi, I'm Ben ðŸ‘‹

Based in Vancouver, WA, I balance a rich family life with a passion for software development. After spending more than a decade consulting at Hint, a company I had the privilege to co-found, I've learned quite a bit about the challenges that dev teams face. Today, I'm channeling these insights into [selective.ci](https://selective.ci), a dev tool aimed to level-up CI.
